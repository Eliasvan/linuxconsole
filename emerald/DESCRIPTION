This file describes the first console driver changes from the Linux Console
Project.  It applies to both the "Sapphire" patch for 2.2.14 and the "Emerald"
patch for 2.3.51.

The second patch band changes fix the double off-by-one error which manifests
itself in the accordion test from vttest.

The third band is a patch from linux-kernel: it has to do with wrongly
neglecting the intensity bit in certain operations.

The other patch bands clean up the code and fix some subtle bugs in
the escape-sequence state machine.

The following changes to the terminal emulation depend on the value
of the VTE_VERSION macro:

Version 200, bug fixes only:

Code	Action		Change		Reason
------	---------------	---------------	----------------------------
\E[21m	turn off 1	removed		Conflicts with ECMA-48
\E[s	DECRC		removed		Not in either VT100 or ECMA-48
\E[u	DECSC		removed		Not in either VT100 or ECMA-48

All three removed capabilities are redundant with other escape
sequences supported by the driver (\E[22m, \E7, and \E8 respectively).
None are or have ever been used by the Linux terminfo/termcap entry.

Version 210, DEC and ECMA-48 enhancements:
