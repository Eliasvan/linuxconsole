The orginal purpose of emerald was to create a patch that allowed for better 
terminal emulation for 2.3.X in the hopes that it would be included in 2.4.X
Unfortunely 2.4.X is coming out and linus is only accepting bug fixes. This 
will be ported over to 2.4.X as soon as it comes out. 

To use this console enhancement just copy this file over to your linux kernel
source tree in the directory drivers/char. Its usually /usr/src/linux so a
cp console.c to /usr/src/linux/drivers/char should do. If you have any questions
just post them to the list.
