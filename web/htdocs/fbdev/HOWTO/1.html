<h2>1.  Introduction</h2>
<hr width="100%" size="2">

<p>
This is the Linux Framebuffer driver HOWTO. It is intended as a quick reference
covering everything you need to know to write a framebuffer video driver under
Linux. Frequently asked questions about video mode setting under Linux are 
answered, and references are given 
to some other sources of information on a variety of topics related to computer 
graphics. Also, read this document not once, not twice but three times if you 
are not familiar with video hardware.
</p>

<p>
The scope is limited to the aspects 
of writing a mode setting video card framebuffer driver pertaining to Linux. 
listed See the other documents in the References section for more general information 
on how to setup framebuffer cards and setting up the XFB_Dev X server.

<h3>1.1.  Acknowledgments</h3>

<p>
Much of this information came from 
the new framebuffer internal API being developed by me for the upcoming next 
series of kernels. Originally, this was based on a patch by Fabrice Bellard. 
I learned of this patch and was impressed by it. Later, I took over development 
and improved it even more. Much thanks goes to Fabrice for getting the ball 
rolling. This API is a natural extension of the original API developed by Martin 
Schaller and now maintained by Geert Uytterhoeven (<a href="mailto:geert@linux-m68k.org">geert@linux-m68k.org</a>). 
Thanks go to you and the many others who developed the Linux framebuffer system, 
drivers and utilities. A great amount of thanks goes to Andreas Beck of the 
GGI project for helping me write this document and teaching me about mode setting. 
Thanks also go out to those who have supported my work. 
</p>

<p>
Thanks to the SGML Tools package, 
this HOWTO is available in several formats, all generated from a common source 
file.

<h3>1.2.  Revision History</h3>

<p>Version 1.0</p>
<p>First version; posted to fbdev mailing list only.</p>
<p>Version 1.1</p>
<p>Updated version; placed into CVS.Updated to reflect new purposed designs in 
   the framebuffer api</p>

<h3>1.3.  New versions of this document</h3>

<p>
New versions of this document will 
be periodically posted to the comp.os.linux.answers newsgroup. They will also 
be uploaded to various anonymous ftp sites that archive such information including 
<a href="ftp://metalabs.unc.edu/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO/">ftp://metalabs.unc.edu/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO/</a>&gt;. 
Hypertext versions of this and other Linux HOWTOs are available on many World-Wide-Web 
sites, including &lt;<a href="http://metalab.unc.edu/LDP/">http://metalab.unc.edu/LDP/</a>&gt;. 
Most Linux CD-ROM distributions include the HOWTOs, often under the /usr/doc 
directory, and you can also buy printed copies from several vendors. Sometimes 
the HOWTOs available from CD-ROM vendors, ftp sites, and printed format are 
out of date. If the date on this HOWTO is more than six months in the past, 
then a newer copy is probably available on the Internet.

Linux HOWTOs can also be found at &lt;<a

</p>

<p>
I am also willing to answer general 
questions on video cards and fbcon under Linux as best I can. Before doing so, 
please read all of the information in this HOWTO and send me detailed information 
about the problem. Please do not ask me about using framebuffer cards under 
operating systems other than Linux.
