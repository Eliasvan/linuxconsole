        * Final port of Russell King's code. Today we are going to
	* start working on a better api for 2.5.

	* Moved xmit circular buffer from struct uart_info to struct uart_port

  	* Removed ops field in uart_info. Instead use in in uart_port instead.

        * Synced to RMK latest changes. He removed the awful table, termios
          stuff from struct uart_driver. This makes life easier for us :-)
  	  He also implemented a struct uart_xxx_port that wraps around the
	  default struct uart_port. From my experience with the fbdev layer
 	  this is a bad idea and will lead to really bad code. This must 
	  change.
