<h2><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3. Actually calculating a mode</font></h2>
<hr width="100%" size="2">
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If you look at the fbdev driver you 
  think yikes. Yes, it's complex, but not as much as you think. A side note about 
  standard modes -- It's a common misconception that graphics cards cannot do 
  anything but the VGA/VESA induced &quot;standard&quot; modes like 640x480, 800x600, 
  1024x768, 1280x960, ... With most cards, about any resolution can be programmed, 
  though many accelerators have been optimized for the above mentioned modes, 
  so that it is usually NOT wise to use other widths, as one might need to turn 
  OFF accelerator support. So if you write a driver, don't cling to these modes. 
  If the card can handle it, allow any mode.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here, the type of monitor has a big 
  impact on what kind of modes we can have. There are two basic types of monitors: 
  fixed frequency (they usually can do multiple vertical frequencies, though, 
  which are much less critical, as they are much lower) and multifrequency. </font></p>
<h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3.1 Fixed frequency monitors</font></h3>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The monitor manual says the horizontal 
  frequency (hfreq) is 31.5 kHz.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We want to display a given mode, 
  say 640x480.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We can now already determine the 
  absolute minimum dotclock we need, as</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">dotclock = horiz_total * 
    hfreq</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">and</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">horiz_total = width + right_border 
    + sync + left_border &gt; width</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The minimum dotclock computes to 
  20.16 MHz. We will probably need something around 20% &quot;slack&quot; for 
  borders and sync, so let's say we need about a 24MHz clock. Now we look at the 
  next higher clock our card can handle, which is 25.175 MHz, as we assume we 
  have a VGA compatible card.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now we can compute the horizontal 
  total:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">horiz_total = dotclock / 
    hfreq = 799.2</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We can only program this as multiples 
  of 8, so we round to 800. Now, we still need to determine the length and placement 
  of the sync pulse, which will give all remaining parameters.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There is no clean mathematical requirement 
  for those. Technically, the sync must be long enough to be detected, and placed 
  in a way that the mode is centered. The centering issue is not very pressing 
  anymore, as digitally controlled monitors are common, which allow to control 
  that externally. Generally, you should place the sync pulse early (i.e. keep 
  right_border small), as this will usually not cause artifacts that would arise 
  from turning on the output again too early when the sync pulse is placed too 
  late.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So, if we as a &quot;rule-of-thumb&quot; 
  use a half of the blanking period for the sync and divide the rest as 1/3 right-border, 
  2/3 left border, we get a modeline of:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;640x480&quot; 25.175   640 
    664 744 800  ??? ??? ??? ???</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While this is not perfectly the same 
  as a standard VGA timing, it should run as well on VGA monitors. The sync is 
  a bit shorter, but that shouldn't be a real problem.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now, for the vertical timing. At 
  480 lines, a VGA monitor uses 60Hz.</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">hfreq = vfreq * vert_total</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This yields a vert_total=525. The 
  vertical timings usually use much less overhead than the horizontal ones, as 
  here we count whole lines. This means much longer delays than just pixels. 10% 
  overhead will suffice here and we again split the borders 1/3: 2/3, with only 
  a few lines (say 2) for the sync pulse, as this is already much longer than 
  a HSYNC and thus easily detectable.</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;640x480&quot; 25.175   640 
    664 744 800   480 495 497 525</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Let us compare that to an XF86 modeline 
  that claims to be standard VGA:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Modeline &quot;640x480&quot;     
    25.175 640  664  760  800   480  491  493  525</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Not much difference - right? They 
  should both work well, just a little shifted against each other vertically.</font></p>
<h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3.2 Multiscan monitor</font></h3>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here we will consider a theoretical 
  monitor that can do hfreq 31-95kHz and vfreq 50-130Hz. Now, let's look at a 
  640x480 mode. Our heuristics say, that we will need about 768x528 (20% and 10% 
  more) for borders and sync. We want a maximum refresh rate, so let's look what 
  limits the mode:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">hfreq = vfreq * vtotal = 
    130 * 528 = 68.6 kHz</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Oh - we cannot use the full hfreq 
  of our monitor... well no problem. What counts is the vfreq, as it determines 
  how much flicker we see.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">O.K. - what pixelclock will we need? 
  </font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">pixclock = hfreq * htotal</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The calculation yields 52.7MHz.  
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now we look what the card can do. 
  Say we have a fixed set of clocks. We look what clocks we have close by. Assume 
  the card can do 50 and 60 MHz.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now we have a choice: We can either 
  use a lower clock, thus scaling down the refresh rate a bit (by 5% ... so what...): 
  This is what one usually does.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Or we can use a higher clock, but 
  this would exceed the monitor specifications. That can be countered by adding 
  more border, but this is usually not done, as it is a waste of space on the 
  screen. However, keep it in mind as a trick for displaying 320x200, when you 
  do not have doubling features. It will display in a tiny window in the middle 
  of the screen, but it will display.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">O.K. - what will our calculation 
  yield?</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;640x480&quot;    50   640 
    664 728 768   480 496 498 528 <i># 65kHz 123Hz</i></font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I just mentioned doubling features. 
  This is how VGA does 320x200. It displays each pixel twice in both directions. 
  Thus it effectively is a 640x400 mode. If this would not be done, you would 
  need a pixelclock of 12.59MHz and you would still have the problem of needing 
  a 140Hz refresh, if hsync should stay at 31.5kHz.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A horizontal doubling feature allows 
  us to use the 25.175MHz clock intended for 640, and a line-doubling feature 
  keeps the vsync the same as 400 lines. Actually the line-doubler is programmable, 
  so you can as well use modes as sick as 640x50.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">O.K. - another example. Same monitor, 
  1280x1024.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now we need about 1536x1126 total 
  (same rule of thumb). That yields 130Hz*1126lines = 146 kHz. We would exceed 
  the hfreq with that, so now the hfreq is the limit and we can only reach a refresh 
  rate of about (95kHz/1126) 84 Hz anymore.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The required clock is now 146MHz. 
  That would yield:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;1280x1024&quot;   146   1280 
    1320 1448 1536   1024 1058 1060 1126 <i># 95kHz 84Hz</i></font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now the clock might be programmable, 
  but keep in mind that there may be limits to the clock. <b>DO NOT OVERCLOCK</b> 
  a graphics card. This will result in the RAMDAC producing blurry images (as 
  it cannot cope with the high speed), and more importantly, the RAMDAC will OVERHEAT 
  and might be destroyed.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Another issue is memory bandwidth. 
  The video memory can only give a certain amount of data per time unit. This 
  often limits the maximum clock at modes with high color depth (i.e. much data 
  per pixel). In the case of my card, it limits the clock to 130MHz at 16-bit 
  depth, which would produce:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;1280x1024&quot;   130   1280 
    1320 1448 1536   1024 1058 1060 1126 <i># 85kHz 75Hz</i></font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This is pretty much what my monitor 
  shows now, if I ask it.</font></p>
<h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3.3 Recipe for multisync monitors</font></h3>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">a) Determine the totals by calculating 
  htotal = width*1.2 and vtotal = height*1.1.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">b) Check what limits the refresh 
  rate by calculating vfreq2 = hfreqmax/vtotal. If that exceeds vfreqmax, the 
  limit is on the vfreq side and we use vfre = vfreqmax and hfreq = vfreqmax*vtotal. 
  If it doesn't, the mode is limited by hfreq and we have to use vfreq = vfreq2. 
  Note, that if this is smaller than vfreqmin, the mode cannot be displayed. In 
  the vfreq-limited case, you might exceed hfreqmin, which can be countered by 
  using line doubling facilities, if available. You can also add extra blank lines 
  (increase vtotal) as a last-resort alternative.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">c) Now that you have hfreq and vfreq, 
  calculate the pixel clock using pixclock=hfreq*htotal. Use the next lower pixel 
  clock. If you are below the lowest clock, you might want to try horizontal doubling 
  features or you will have to pad the mode by increasing htotal.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">d) Again, check the monitor limits. 
  You might be violating lower bounds now... In that case you might need to resort 
  to choosing a higher clock and padding as well.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">e) You now have pixclock, width, 
  height, htotal and vtotal. Calculate the sync start positions: hss=width+(htotal-width)/2/3; 
  vss=height+(vtotal-height)/3. Make sure to properly align them as required by 
  the video card hardware. hss usually has to be a multiple of 8.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">f) SyncEnd is calculated similarly: 
  hse=hss+(htotal-width)/2 and vse=vss+2.</font></p>
<h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3.4 Recipe for Monosync</font></h3>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">a) Calculate the number of lines. 
  As hfreq and vfreq are given, vtotal is fixed: vtotal=hfreq/vfreq. If there 
  are multiple vfreqs allowed, choose them according to your desired vtotal (i.e. 
  one that gives the lowest vtotal above what you really need).</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">b) Calculate the pixelclock. pixclock=hfreq*htotal. 
  htotal starts at the same estimate (width*1.2) we used above.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">c) Adjust the pixelclock to hardware-limits. 
  Adjust <b>UP</b>. Now recalculate the htotal=pixclock/hfreq.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">d) Go to 3.3. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">An important final word. Most video 
  card documentations give you the exact equations needed to set a mode. Here, 
  we give approached values. Use the exact values given in the documents.</font></p>
<h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3.5 Colors</font></h3>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There exist an endless number of 
  colors, but colors have a special property. If you take two colors and mix them 
  together you get a different color. There exist many models to represent colors, 
  but fbdev is based on what is known as the RGB color model. Out of all the colors, 
  there exist three colors in this model which when mixed in different amounts 
  can produce any color. These colors are known as primary colors. There does 
  exist a physical limit to mixing colors. If you take and mix red, green, and 
  blue in equal amounts you get gray. Now if you make each color component equally 
  brighter, the final color will become white. Now their reaches a point when 
  making each component brighter and brighter you will still end up with white. 
  You can increase the intensity of a color component by any amount from some 
  initial value up to this physical limit. This is where the image depth comes 
  in. As you know, on most cards you can have an image depth from one bit to 32 
  bits. Image depth is independent of the mapping from the pixel to the color 
  components. It is also independent of the memory layout to pixel mapping. Note 
  that some cards have a complex mapping from the pixel values to the color components 
  (red, blue, green) as well as video memory to pixel mapping. If this is the 
  case, you will have to consult your documentation on your video card to see 
  what the mapping exactly is. Here are the mappings defined from top to bottom 
  in fbdev starting with the value of the color components:</font></p>

</table>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The way fbdev tells what this video 
  memory to pixel mapping is, is with the type field in </font><i><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">fb_fix_screeninfo</font></i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. 
  Here, I'm going to describe the </font><i><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">FB_TYPE_PACKED_PIXELS</font></i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
  layout since it is the most common. Here, there exists a direct mapping from 
  video memory to a pixel value. If you place a 5 in video memory then the pixel 
  value at that position will be 5. This is important when you have memory mapped 
  the video memory to userland. Next, we consider the mapping from a pixel value 
  to the colors. This is represented in the fbdev API by the visual field in </font><i><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">fb_fix_screeninfo</font></i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. 
  As you can see from the above diagram, this mapping is independent from the 
  mapping from video memory to pixel value. This means that </font><i><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">FB_TYPE_PLANES</font></i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i> 
  </i>could have<i> </i></font><i><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">FB_VISUAL_MONO01</font></i> 
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">just like </font><i><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">FB_TYPE_PACKED_PIXELS</font></i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
  can.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To understand visuals, we have to 
  go back to the first types of video hardware. In the beginning there was just 
  monochrome monitors. Here we could only display 2 colors: the foreground and 
  background color. Traditionally, these colors are black and white, but if you 
  are old enough, you would remember the old green monitors. In the fbdev API, 
  we define two types of monochrome modes. The difference between the two is that 
  the foreground and background colors are swapped.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Then computers began to support color. 
  The only problem was they could only display a small number of colors at one 
  time. What if you wanted to have an application display a certain set of colors. 
  Well, the way that was developed to get around this was the idea of a color 
  map. A color map translated a pixel value to the colors needed. If your application 
  needs a specific set of colors it would switch the color maps and you would 
  get the needed colors. Of course, this also switches the other colors in the 
  applications. That was the trade off. This became what is known as pseudocolor 
  mode. In the fbdev API, there exist two types of pseudocolor mappings -- A static 
  one and a dynamic one. </font></p>
<p><i><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">FB_VISUAL_STATIC_PSEUDOCOLOR</font></i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
  defines a video card that has a non-programmable color map. What colors you 
  get are what you are stuck with. The other type of color map can be changed.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In time, video cards started to support 
  more colors but this required having a larger color map. Also, video memory 
  prices started to drop and video cards began to sell with more of it. To properly 
  support 256 color intensity levels for each color component, you would need 
  a color map of 16 million colors. New mappings where developed in which specific 
  fields of a pixel where directly proportional to the intensity of a color component. 
  Two types of mappings were developed -- One being truecolor and the other directcolor. 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In truecolor, you cannot change the 
  mappings from the pixel value to color intensities. Setting a value of 64 to 
  the red component of the pixel will result in a red intensity of 64. How bright 
  of a red this is depends on the image depth. For directcolor, you can control 
  this. You could make a pixel value in the red field of 64 equal 128 for the 
  intensity. Also some cards support an alpha value, which is used in higher graphics, 
  which for fbdev is of little importance. It should always be set to the highest 
  value it can have. For most cards, alpha shows up for 15-bit modes where each 
  color component can have up to 32 intensity levels (2^5) and one bit represents 
  the alpha component. It also shows up for 32-bit modes where each component 
  red, blue, green, and alpha are given 256 intensity levels (2^8). 24-bit mode 
  is like 32-bit mode except it lacks the alpha component. An important note is 
  that some cards only support 24-bit mode on certain architectures.</font></p>
