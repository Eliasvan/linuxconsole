<H1>Charter and Objectives:</H1>

Our charter is to clean up and properly maintain the Linux console/TTY
sub system.  There has been scattered work on the console and TTY layer
going on for some time.  This project will try to pull it all together
into a coherent architecture from which we can generate clean patches 
for Linus and the core kernel team.<p>

Right now the console subsystem and the subsystems that are depended on 
it have a couple of problems as well as some design issues which need 
to be address for todays needs:

<ol>
<li>

<li>Terminal emulation is much too intertwined with the lower 
    levels of the console implementation. Eventually terminal
    emulations should be loadable modules and/or easily replacable.<p> 

<li>The various subsystems are intertwined with the console system.
    Things like the serial, framebuffer, and input layer should be
    able to exist independent of the console/TTY layer. Especially 
    on embedded devices this is important.<p>

<li>The console system is to vga centeric in design. We designed it
    to be more platform independent.<p>

<li>The built-in ANSI X3.64/ECMA-48 terminal emulation is incomplete
    and in some respects incorrect.<p>
</ol>

<H1> New Features:</H1>

<ul>
<li> Multi-desktop operation -- console instances running on multiple
     (possibly dissimilar) video cards and seperate keyboards.
<li> With the new console locking mechanism the underlying drivers can
     be DMA/irq based for maximum speed.
<li> Much simpler framebuffer api. Plus with the new design it is possible
     to use framebuffer devices without a VT. 
<li> The console system input system is based solely on the input api. This
     allows for things like a universal keymap. No more compiling in new
     keymaps for every type of different keybaords out their. Plus with this
     design it is possible to use a keyboard without the console system.
<li> New serial API. The serial layer is more like the parport layer now.
     Having to using the TTY layer for something like a serial mouse is
     plain silly. The idea is to create a basic serial API and register
     device interfaces. For a modem youwould want to register a TTY interface
     whereas for a serial mouse or joystick we woudl want to register a
     interface for the input api.
<li> Support for hot plug. We can add or remove graphics cards or even 
     keyboards to create new desktop VTs.     
<li> A scrollback buffer implemented in the console itself.
<li> Support for different fonts, and textmodes per VC.
<li> Better Unicode support. You will be able to display Kanji on the
     command line. Bidirectional support.
<li> Not really apart of the console system, force feedback is a important
     element to the input layer that this project is also working.
</ul>

<H1>Project Status and News:</H1>

Development is moving fast. Since we cover alot of areas of the linux kernel
we have seperate links to pages that have developements to each different
sub system<p>   

<a href="input/input.html">Input API</a> 

<H1>Getting Involved</H1>

So you like to try out this new system or even better yet contribute. If you
like to give it a try <a href="quick.html">click here</a> for instructions.

Once it try it out we know you will have questions or just want to tell you
your experiences we have a public developement mailing list. Also our list 
is archived. If you like to join follow this <a
href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/linuxconsole-dev">link</a>.

Now if you like to get your hands dirty an get invloved I recommend going our
<a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/linuxconsole-commit">CVS
commit mailing list</a>. Here you will see all the changes going on. A must
for developers and a great way to learn how the new TTY/console layer works.
Plus each page for subscribing has a link to the maling list archives.<p>

Last but not least is our <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/?group_id=3063">SourceForge page</a>.<p>
