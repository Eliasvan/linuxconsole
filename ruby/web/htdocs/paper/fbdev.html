Restructing the framebuffer layer</A>
</H2>

<P>
    If you look at the current framebuffer console layer you will see a lot 
of replicated code and and huge amount of code handling tty/console functionality.

</P>

<P>
    The primary goal is to remove the console code from fbdev and place it
into fbcon.c. This reduces the code and makes writing a new fbdev driver
easy since the author doesn't need to worry about console internals. It
also allows the ability to run fbdev without a console/tty system on top
of it.
</P>

<P>
   First the roles of struct fb_info and struct display have changed. Struct
display will go away. The way the the new framebuffer console code will
work is that it will act to translate data about the tty/console in
struct vc_data to data in a device independent way in struct fb_info. Then
various functions in struct fb_ops will be called to store the device
dependent state in the par field in struct fb_info and to change the
hardware to that state. This allows a very clean separation of the fbdev
layer from the console layer. It also allows one to use fbdev on its own
which is a bonus for embedded devices. The reason this approach works is
because each framebuffer device, when used as a tty/console device, is allocated
a set of virtual terminals to it. Only one virtual terminal can be active
per framebuffer device. We already have all the data we need in struct
vc_data so we shouldn't store a bunch of colormaps and other fbdev specific data
per virtual terminal.
</P>

<P>
  As you can see doing this makes the con parameter pretty much useless
for struct fb_ops functions, as it should be. Also having struct
fb_var_screeninfo and other data in fb_info pretty much eliminates the
need for get_fix and get_var. Once all drivers use the fix, var, and cmap
fbcon can be written around these fields. This will also eliminate the
need to regenerate struct fb_var_screeninfo, struct fb_fix_screeninfo
struct fb_cmap every time get_var, get_fix, get_cmap functions are called
as many drivers do now.
