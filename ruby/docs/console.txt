				Abstract

		This documentation describes a proposal for a new console system	for linux. The goal of the new design is break the interdepenancy of 
	many subsystems on the console system. In this model the console system
	instead is a abstract layer constructed of seperate hardware subsystems 
	that can function on their own. Such a design allows for much more 
	flexability.

1. Introduction

	As linux is ported to more and more different flavors of hardware we
are beginning to see the need to redesign many parts of the kernel. The reason
being that linux was originally done on the 32 bit intel platform. Thus many
parts of the kernel design was ix86 centeric. Over time this has changed and
still continues to change. The console redesign is another such a change to 
support the needs of these many new devices to linux.
